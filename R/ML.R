# CyTOF
# get subtypes proportions (normed by tumor content)
# get overall immune score (% of immune cells)
# get protein expression per cell type

# RNA
# eigen genes (cluster scores from Clust)
# gene expression of Clust slelected genes (500 genes)
# Deconvolution results

# WES
# binary matrix for somatic mutations, remove genes that are mutated in less than 5% of samples
